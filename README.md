# SELCEM 
Sustainable Engineering Lab Clean Energy Model (SELCEM) is an energy system capacity expansion model, using Gurobi optimizer and coding in Python. 
This repository includes a simple one-node, one year version. 
The formulation can access through [SELCEM_FORMULATION.pdf](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/SELCEM/blob/master/SELCEM_FORMULATION.pdf)


## One-Node System
The basic easy-to-use model, includes the parameters, variables, and constraints in the single file. <br />

**File**: <br />
[one_node_system.py](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/SELCEM/blob/master/one_node_system.py) - 
At once the input data set up, the file can be run individually.
