# SELCEM - OneNode
Sustainable Engineering Lab Clean Energy Model (SELCEM) is an energy system capacity expansion model, using Gurobi optimizer and coding in Python. 
This repository includes a simple one-node, one year version. 
The formulation can access through [SELCEM_formulation_simple.pdf](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/SELCEM-OneNode/blob/master/SELCEM_formulation_simple.pdf)

**File**: <br />
[one_node_system.py](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/SELCEM-OneNode/blob/master/one_node_system.py) The basic easy-to-use model, includes the parameters, variables, and constraints in the single file. <br />
Please check the input time series in the 'input_data' folder.
